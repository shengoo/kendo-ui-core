In this article you will learn how [OpenAccess ORM](http://www.telerik./com/products/orm.aspx) can be leveraged on the backend, and [Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) can take care of the UI.

## Set up the project

To get started create a new **Telerik MVC Web Application.**

![New Web Project](/images/oa1.png)

When you are asked about the Data Access approach you can select *Skip creating a Telerik Data Access Model Library Project*

This will create an empty Telerik UI for MVC project.

Now we are ready to build the OpenAccess ORM model!

## Build The Model

To build an OpenAccess ORM data model, select the Telerik menu item, select **Telerik Data Access-->Add Domain Model**

*Note: If you do not have OpenAccess ORM installed, you can get the trial
edition [here](http://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file.aspx?pid=638).*

![Build The Model](/images/oa3.png)

In the next window select **Populate from Database**, and click **Next**.

Set up a connection to NorthwindOA, which is installed with OpenAccess, and
then click next.

At this point go ahead and include all tables from the database in the data
model.

Click finish, and step 2 is done!  The data model is ready to be used.  The
next step is to expose this data model through a service layer.

## Build The Service Layer

Perform a **build** on the application, and right click on the `.rlinq` file in the
solution explorer. Select **Add Telerik Data Access Service**, and the domain service wizard will fire up.

Select the EntitiesModel context in the wizard, and click Next.

This screen allows you to configure the service that will be created.  Select the ** WCF Service - OData v3**, option and then click Next.

On this screen you can change the name of the service and select which tables to be included. Click **Finish** and your service will be created.

## Connect the OData Service to a Kendo Grid

Now all that is left to do is configure the front end.  For now we will wire up the Orders to a Kendo UI grid, but feel free to take it even further! Kendo UI has a lot of cool features to play around with.

First thing we need to do is edit the *Global.asax.cs* file and add the following route configuration in RegisterRoutes method:

    RouteTable.Routes.IgnoreRoute("EntitiesModelService.svc/{*pathInfo}"); //here you need to specify the correct service path

Next, we need to set up the grid.  Kendo UI's web site provides many [great examples](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/web/grid/index.html) of how to configure binding; so I won't go into too much detail here.  The basic idea is that we need a div that will be used as the container for the Kendo UI grid, and then we just have to configure the grid in script.

The code needed is here:

    <!--Will be turned into a kendo-ized grid! -->
    <div id="grid"></div>

    <!-- configure grid-->
    <script>

        // document ready fires when the whole page is ready
        // and all elements, scripts, styles have been loaded
        $(function () {

            // regex for some date parsing
            // select the div and create the grid element
            $("#grid").kendoGrid({
                dataSource: {
                    type: "odata",
                    transport: {
                        read: "/EntitiesModelService.svc/Orders"
                    },
                    schema: {
                        data: "value",
                        total: "['odata.count']",
                        model: {
                            fields: {
                                OrderID: { type: "number" },
                                Freight: { type: "number" },
                                ShipName: { type: "string" },
                                OrderDate: { type: "date" },
                                ShipCity: { type: "string" }
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    pageSize: 10,
                    serverPaging: true,
                    serverFiltering: true,
                    serverSorting: true
                },
                filterable: true,
                sortable: true,
                pageable: true,
                columns: [
                    {
                        field: "OrderID",
                        filterable: false
                    },
                    "Freight",
                    {
                        field: "OrderDate"
                    },
                    "ShipName",
                    "ShipCity"
                ]
            });

        });

    </script>

Now run the application. If all went well you should be presented with a great looking grid:

## Conclusions

The OpenAccess ORM Visual Designer and Service Layer Generator make it extremely easy to get started working with Kendo UI.  In fact, we only had to write 1 line of server side code thanks to these great tools!
