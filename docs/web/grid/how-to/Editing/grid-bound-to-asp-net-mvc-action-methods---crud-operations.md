# Grid bound to ASP.NET MVC action methods - CRUD operations

This example illustrates remote CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Destroy) data operations using Grid bound to ASP.NET MVC action methods.

The [example source code](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc/tree/master/grid-crud) is available in the [Kendo UI ASP.NET MVC code samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-examples-asp-net-mvc).

> You need to save the changes to commit the destroy operations to the server. Clicking the "Delete" button will not hit the server immediately.
