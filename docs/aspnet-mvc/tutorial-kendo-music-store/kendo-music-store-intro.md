# Tutorial: Kendo UI Music Store: Introduction

In this tutorial, we will review portions of the **Kendo UI Music Store** sample project.

The Music Store sample includes two projects: a web application and a dashboard.

# Kendo UI Music Store Web

This sample project was based on Microsoft's [MVC Music Store](http://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/), so much of the
server-side processing and the data structure are reused in this project.
The UI of the music store was completely redesigned with Kendo UI.
It focuses on [Kendo UI Professional](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui), how it was used and the ways in which it interacts with ASP.NET MVC, WebAPI and WCF Data Services.
