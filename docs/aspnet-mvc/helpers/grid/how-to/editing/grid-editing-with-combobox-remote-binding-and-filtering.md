# Grid editing using ComboBox with remote binding and filtering

This project demonstrates how to to implement [custom MVVM binding](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/framework/mvvm/bindings/custom) and disable the default value binding for a ComboBox in order to prevent initial binding when selected value is set. This approach can be used to avoid the default [value binding](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/framework/mvvm/bindings/value#use-the-value-binding-with-a-select-whose-options-are-created-by-the-source-binding) behavior when the ComboBox is bound to a great amount of data.
