# Post grid data with form

This project shows how to submit the grid data items as part of a `Html.Form`

There are several known limitations:

* all the items in the grid will be submitted (no matter if they are updated or not)
* only the items from the current page will be submitted
* server operations must be disabled - `ServerOperation(false)`
