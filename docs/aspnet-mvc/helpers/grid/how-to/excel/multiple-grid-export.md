# Multiple Grid Export

This example shows how to export two Kendo UI grids in the same Excel document. Each grid is exported in a separate Excel sheet.
For additional info check [Create Excel Documents](/framework/excel/introduction#create-excel-document).

> This project requires UI for ASP.NET MVC version 2014.3.1125 and up. Earlier versions don't have the `ExcelExport` event exposed via the fluent API.
