# Color the Alternating Rows

This example shows how to customize the Excel document that the grid generates during exporting.

The demo uses the [background](/api/javascript/ooxml/workbook#configuration-sheets.rows.cells.background) option of the cell to set the background color of the alternating rows.

To understand how Excel documents work check the [Excel Introduction](/framework/excel/introduction#create-excel-document) help topic.

> This project requires UI for ASP.NET MVC version 2014.3.1125 and up. Earlier versions don't have the `ExcelExport` event exposed via the fluent API.
