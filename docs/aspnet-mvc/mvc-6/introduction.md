# Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC 6 - Beta 4
This tutorial shows how to use Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC in ASP.NET MVC 6 applications.

> The ASP.NET 5 Framework is still actively developed. Tooling and APIs change frequently, often requiring extensive changes.
See [Known Issues](known-issues) for up-to-date information.

# Requirements and Supported Environments

We target the stable release of the ASP.NET 5 framework. At the time of this writing this is Beta 4.

The target runtime is [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr). The full desktop CLR is also supported.

# ASP.NET on GitHub

The following repositories contain source code, instructions and issue trackers for the ASP.NET project.
These are immensely useful when you need to track down particular issues or behaviors.

- ASP.NET [Home on GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/home)
- ASP.NET [MVC on GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc)

# Running the Sample Application on Windows

- Install [Visual Studio 2015 RC](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx)
- Download the `telerik.ui.for.aspnetmvc` commercial or trial package.
- Extract the `wrappers\aspnetmvc\Examples\VS2015` folder into `C:\MVC6` or similar.
- Open the `C:\MVC6\Kendo.Mvc.Examples\Kendo.Mvc.Examples.xproj` project in Visual Studio.
- Wait for the packages to restore and run the application.
