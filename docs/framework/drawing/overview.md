# Overview

The Kendo UI Drawing API is a cross-browser vector graphics library.
It offers a simple object model for building and manipulating visual "scenes".

You build a scene by creating drawing elements such as curves, images and text.
Scene elements are live and respond to changes of their appearance and geometry.

A drawing surface is used to render scenes on and off screen.
Surfaces encapsulate specific browser technologies such as SVG or Canvas.

## Design Goals

The Kendo UI Drawing API is designed to serve as a foundation
and extension point for the Kendo UI DataViz widgets.

The Drawing API is also a stand-alone component suitable
for building custom visualizations.
