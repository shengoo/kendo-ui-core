# Kendo UI Accessibility Overview

## An Introduction to Accessibility

Web Accessibility, simply put, is the creation of sites and applications that can be fully experienced by the broadest number of users. That includes
disabled users, who typically visit the sites we create with the help of assistive technologies, like a screen reader.

For the most basic, text-driven web experiences, these technologies work well, and disabled users benefit greatly. But the web has exploded well
beyond the realm of text-based experiences in the last decade, and assistive technologies have struggled to keep up.

The good news is that there is something that we can do as web developers to easily bridge the gap to those assistive technologies, which enables
these tools to better aid disabled users as they interact with the sites we create. By providing things like full keyboard support, high-contrast
visual elements, text-based equivalents of non-text elements and by adhering to standards like [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/),
[WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov), we have the tools we need, as developers, to create accessible,
rich Internet applications.
